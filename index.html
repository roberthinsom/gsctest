    <h1>How to Add Google Search Console to Your Website</h1>
    
    <p>Google Search Console (formerly known as Google Webmaster Tools) is a free service provided by Google that helps you monitor and maintain your site's presence in Google Search results. Adding your website to Google Search Console is a crucial step for any website owner or webmaster.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 1: Sign in or Create a Google Account</h2>
    <p>If you don't have one already, you'll need to sign up for a Google account. If you already have one, simply sign in to your account.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 2: Go to Google Search Console</h2>
    <p>Once you're signed in, navigate to the Google Search Console website by typing "Google Search Console" into your search engine or by visiting <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/">https://search.google.com/search-console/</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 3: Add Your Website</h2>
    <p>Click on the "Start Now" button and enter the URL of your website into the provided field. Make sure to enter the full URL, including the "https://" or "http://" prefix.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 4: Verify Ownership</h2>
    <p>There are several methods available for verifying ownership of your website. The recommended method is to use the HTML file upload option:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Download the HTML file provided by Google.</li>
        <li>Upload this file to the root directory of your website using an FTP client or file manager provided by your hosting provider.</li>
        <li>Once uploaded, return to Google Search Console and click the "Verify" button.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Step 5: Submit a Sitemap</h2>
    <p>After verifying ownership, it's a good idea to submit a sitemap of your website to Google. A sitemap is a file that contains a list of all the pages on your site, helping search engines discover and crawl your content more efficiently.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 6: Explore Google Search Console Features</h2>
    <p>Once your website is added and verified, you can explore the various features and reports available in Google Search Console. These include performance data, indexing status, mobile usability, and more. Regularly monitoring your site's performance in Google Search Console can help you identify and address any issues that may affect your site's visibility in search results.</p>
    
    <p>Congratulations! You've successfully added your website to Google Search Console. Remember to regularly check in on your site's performance and make adjustments as needed to improve your presence in Google Search results.</p>
